The Promise "object" represents the eventual completion/failure 
of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.


A promise is in one of these states:

1. pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. fulfiled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully
3. rejected: meaning that the operation failed
